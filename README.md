# Twitter-LDA
Latent topic analysis (LDA) written in Python using corpus of tweets

For this analysis, the script was run between 7pm, Saturday December 15 to 10am on Sunday, 
December 16 2018 and collected 714,575 tweets in English.

Of the 714,575 tweets collected, only 141,487 qualified for analysis. Within those tweets, 
13,598 of those words were unique and totaled 686,764 words.

Obviously, this would have been substantially more robust had we colected more tweets 
(perhaps an order or magnitude more?). Otherwise, this was a successful exercise
